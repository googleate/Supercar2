BMW defines the BMW i8 as "the most innovative car we have ever created." This sports car has been surprising locals and strangers for some time with a design and appearance that seems to come from the future. It has a very radical design, scissor doors and 374 hp hybrid-plug-in mechanics, a key point in the concept of the German model.

Its design is, without a doubt, the most innovative and futuristic of all that we can find in the current range of the Bavarian manufacturer. Its low and aggressive front combines perfectly with very marked lines, ending in a rear with floating surfaces and muscular lines, according to the approach of the model.

The benefits of the BMW i8 are not far behind. In the sprint from 0 to 100 km / h it is as fast as a BMW M2, it does it in just 4.4 seconds. But when it comes to saving fuel it is as efficient as the most, being able to travel up to 55 kilometers in electric mode and boasting (according to official approval for plug-in hybrids) of its 1.9 liters / 100 kilometers. This powertrain is used, in fact, for other manufacturer models such as the BMW 225xe or the MINI Cooper SE Countryman, although with a lower power and performance index.
