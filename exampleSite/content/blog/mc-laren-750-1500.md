The details that are perceived in the forms of the McLaren 750. Elements such as the design of the rear, called to increase downforce, or the line of the doors, whose mission is to provide more air flow to the engine, are some examples of this.

The bodywork, mounted on a MonoCell II carbon fiber chassis, has been designed with the use of the supercar for day-to-day use in mind, or so Woking believes. To do this, they have improved access to the passenger compartment and have increased the levels of protection, while reducing 150 kg of mass using aluminum.

On the wheels, shod with Pirelli P Zero Corsa 225/35 R 19 front and 285/35 R 20 rear tires, we find carbon-ceramic brakes as standard.

The exterior line shows the evolution of the Super Series and Ultimate Series, with specific elements such as the lower air intakes, the headlights equipped with LED technology, which will be standard throughout the range, or the air flow channels. through the hood and fins, all the way to the door design, where the air flow is divided between that which must enter the engine compartment and that which must slide across the surface of the side of the vehicle. Finally, the fall of the roof in two pieces that McLaren calls flying buttresses - like the outer half arches that we find in Gothic architecture - has its reason for being in the need to generate a greater aerodynamic load without resorting to ailerons. In this way, a more fluid aesthetic is achieved and greater continuity to the teardrop shape that we observe in the cabin.
