**350€/ D**

Endless amount of gadgets on this car

3\.0-liter diesel,

254 hp

442 pound-feet of torque

• 7 seats ( two full-size adults can sit in the way back in surprising comfort, with respectable head-, knee- and toe- room).

• All aboard can stay connected with the available 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot, and there’s a faintly ridiculous nine USB ports and six 12-volt outlets

• In Control Touch Pro (ITP) architecture, lavished on a 10.2-inch touch screen that features programmable home screen widgets, crisp graphics and pinch-to-zoom functionality.

• Powered center cooler box, which can chill four bottles of water.

• InControl also includes a phone app that allows you to push a navigation route from your phone directly to the navigation system, along with other remote activities like engine start, climate control and locking.

• There’s even Apple Watch integration and as an adjacency, an available waterproof Fitbit-like wristband dubbed the Activity Key. This RFID-enabled rubberized loop allows you to lock your key fob inside the vehicle when going mountain biking, surfing or perhaps when when you just want to rock your super-skinny jeans.
