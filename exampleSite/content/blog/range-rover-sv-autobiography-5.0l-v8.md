This car in our opinion as good if not better than travelling in a Rolls Royce, plus is as fast as a sports car and V8 Supercharge exhaust sound is music to any Petrol head.

Inside there is masses of super luxurious touches adorning the cabin including, four-zone climate control that can be remotely controlled, heated steering wheel and rear seats, ventilated front seats, massaging seats, and a 10.2in touch screen infotainment system complete with DAB tuner, sat nav, Bluetooth, USB connectivity and a TV tuner.

The long wheelbase version gains perforated leather seats, a heated wood and leather steering wheel, folding tables in the rear, a bottle chiller and electric sunblinds.
