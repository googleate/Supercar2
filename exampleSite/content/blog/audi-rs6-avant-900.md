The Audi RS6 Avant ABT uses new modifications to make the whole work even more special. Although, in this case the preparer has worked on the exhaust system and the suspension equipment, getting the saloon to move even faster and more safely.

This program of modifications is designed for the new Audi RS6 Avant, the new model of the division that uses the powerful 4.0-liter V8 biturbo engine that develops a whopping **600 horsepower** and 800 Nm of torque. A brutal set that can get up a notch with these modifications.

The company has assembled four tailpipes working on this system to achieve a more exciting sound. Although, we can modify the sound of the sports saloon to adjust the melody to each occasion. The exhaust system is made of stainless steel and features new external and middle silencers.
