The Italian luxury sports car firm Maserati has presented at the Shanghai Motor Show a new saloon smaller than the current Quattroporte, which will be the first model in the history of the brand to equip a diesel engine with 275 horsepower. It will also have two gasoline engines, on the same twin-turbo V6 block, with powers of 330 and 410 horsepower. The new Maserati Ghibli measures 4.97 meters in length compared to 5.26 meters for the Quattroporte, which places it in the segment where it will meet rivals such as the Audi A7 Sportback (4.97 meters) or the BMW 6 Series Gran Coupé (5 meters). The wheelbase is 20 centimeters shorter than that of the Quattroporte. The exterior lines of the Ghibli are sharp, "feline" according to the brand information and the front grille is inspired by that of the GranTurismo.

One of the great novelties of this model is the diesel engine with direct injection common rail technology, of 275 horsepower. Its 0-100 km / h acceleration is 6.3 seconds, its average consumption is 6 liters per hundred kilometers and CO2 emissions are 160 grams per kilometer. This version equips a sound improvement system so as not to clash with the rest of the range with gasoline engines, since the sound of the Maserati is one of its peculiarities most admired by its followers.
