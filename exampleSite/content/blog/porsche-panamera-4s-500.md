The 2021 Porsche Panamera 4S E-Hybrid perfectly represents this complex equation. It is the new intermediate option within the plug-in hybrid range, which achieves, compared to the 4 E-Hybrid of 2017, to offer more power and also greater electric autonomy.

The powertrain is still made up of the magnificent 2.9 V6 biturbo engine, 'shared' with Audi, which in this version delivers 440 hp. Nor does the 136 hp electric motor, located in the forward position, coupled to the PDK dual-clutch eight-speed transmission, which also remains unchanged. What changes is the battery, which goes from 14.1 to 17.9 kWh of capacity.

So with a more powerful gasoline engine and an optimized battery, you can achieve that hard-to-get squaring of the circle. In ecological terms, the car declares 53 kilometers of electric autonomy and carries the DGT label 0.
