The BMW M2, a compact 360-horsepower sports coupe that, to everyone's surprise, did not just play the supporting role it seemed to have been assigned in the shadow of the M4. It was so well done that it soon earned the title of best BMW M of the decade. Now they have replaced it with the 410 hp BMW M2 Competition. We have tested it and are still looking for excuses to get back on it.

Making the decision to change the BMW M2 should not have been easy, as this model enjoyed such brutal success from its birth that there was even speculation with prices and some M2s were sold more expensive second-hand than they cost new.

There was a kind of fever, everyone wanted to have a BMW M2, and that was a sign that this car was not just another M. It was, as I said when testing the manual version and later that beauty equipped with 20,000 euros of M Performance extras, the best that BMW M had done since the M3 E46.
