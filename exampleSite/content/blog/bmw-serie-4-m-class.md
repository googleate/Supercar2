+++
The BMW 4 Series marks the beginning of a new era, as it is a clearly independent vehicle due to its great width and wheelbase.

The short overhangs, the elongated and curved engine hood and the rearward-shifted passenger compartment set the design apart and contribute to a sharper silhouette. Typical brand features, such as round dual headlights, flat dual grille and Hofmeister curve on the rear pillar, create a striking contrast to the wide rear that includes sleek headlights. Particularly noteworthy are the wide wheel arches, which give the first-generation BMW 4 Series an imposing appearance. Its precise and uncompromising design continues inside. A functional design and driver-oriented geometry make driving the vehicle a unique experience.
