It combines traditional elegance with the most current comfort. Its imposing presence confirms this premise from any perspective. The majesty of this vehicle is appreciated at first glance. Its sleek, robust silhouette and noble chrome accents live up to the expectations raised by the distinctive 'Maybach', located on the eye-catching front end in conjunction with the elegant MULTIBEAM LED headlamps. Inside, a generous feeling of spaciousness awaits you and a design that reconciles the characteristics of a multifunctional office with those of an exclusive lounge. It doesn't matter if you need a folding desk or champagne glasses: in the Mercedes-Maybach S-Class, it is your wishes that count.

Maximum luxury for all the senses. The ENERGIZING comfort control generates small impulses that can significantly improve your well-being, and even your mood. This device connects different vehicle comfort systems, such as THERMOTRONIC or the massage and scent functions, together and groups them into six defined programs.

The latest generation of the Mercedes S-Class offers a continuous aesthetic with respect to its predecessor in general terms, however it has its own details that make it easily recognizable from your eyes. We are talking about a large car, with 5,179 mm in length in its short wheelbase version (3,106 mm) and 5,289 mm in its long wheelbase version (3,165 mm). Among its most notable points in terms of design we find the large front grill or the LED optics, especially the rear ones with a horizontal design that completely break with the image of its predecessor and are based on the aesthetics of models such as the CLS or the CLA. Of these models it also takes care to offer a very low drag coefficient, a Cx of just 0.22, resulting in one of the most successful cars on the market in this regard. In the case of the trunk we find a maximum volume of 550 liters.
