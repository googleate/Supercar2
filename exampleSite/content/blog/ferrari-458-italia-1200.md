Its most radical version, the Ferrari 458 Speciale, reaches 605 hp.

The maximum torque is 540 Nm at 6000 rpm, although the most important thing about this engine is that it boasts of offering very high torque at low revs, in fact at only 3250 rpm it develops more than 80% of the maximum torque. The efficiency of the new engine is reflected in the consumption that is reduced to about 13.7 liters / 100 km (combined cycle) with emissions of 320 g / km of CO2.

In addition, the engineers have achieved an optimal weight distribution with 58% on the rear axle and the rest on the front axle. The new chassis will integrate the E-Diff and F1-Trac differentials, which will be controlled by the ECU itself and which manage to increase the acceleration at the exit of the curves by 32%. It has high-performance ABS brakes capable of braking from 100 km / h to 0 in just 32.5 meters.
