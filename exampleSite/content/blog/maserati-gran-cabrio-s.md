The Maserati Gran Turismo Cabrio exhibits superb handling dynamics, jaw-dropping body style, and a luxurious interior.

The most impressive characteristics are its sleek design and smooth handling dynamics. It’s a car that people hire, not because they fall in love with its performance numbers, but because they fall in love with its style.

The GranTurismo cabrio isn’t the right car for someone looking for pure performance. Yes, it offers blistering acceleration and handles hairpin corners with ease compared to the average sports car, but it actually trails most exotic cars in those tasks — and its brakes take a beating in the press.

“The GranTurismo has to be one of the smoothest cars on the road to rent , in more ways than one,” says Carlo Mason ( owner of Blue Sky ) “It is not the fastest, smartest, or best value on the market, but the GranTurismo has flair in great quantity.”

It features a 405-horsepower V8 engine and six-speed automatic transmission with manumatic shifting.
