This SuperCar is identified by its massive carbon-fiber rear spoiler, the GT R Roadster it is the new drop top king of the Marbella roads.

Just 750 units worldwide so this car does not come cheap so the privilege of renting this car makes it even more remarkable

It has a twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8, seven-speed dual-clutch automatic,rear-wheel steering, electronically controlled limited-slip differential and active aerodynamic addenda.

Our car features three layers of fabric stretched over an aluminium, magnesium, and steel frame.

Our Version produces 603 horsepower at 6250 rpm—108 more horses than the standard GT and 17 more than the GT C model..

Press its start button, and the GT R’s V-8 erupts to life and idles like it belongs in a NASCAR garage. It doesn’t roar, it thunders. Your neighbours will hear you leave in the morning. Tightly wound and intense, the GT R is Just an amazing machine
